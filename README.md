A simple Unreal Engine 4 sample project that showcases dynamic damage over meshes. Shoot at the armored robot to blast its armor and see through it. I also provide three different shooting styles to test how this effect behaves with some of the most common weapon types in FPS games: a marksman rifle, a full auto rifle, and the mighty shotgun!
