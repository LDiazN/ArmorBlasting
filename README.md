A simple Unreal Engine 4 sample project that showcases dynamic damage over meshes. Shoot at the armored robot to blast its armor and see through it. I also provide three different shooting styles to test how this effect behaves with some of the most common weapon types in FPS games: a marksman rifle, a full auto rifle, and the mighty shotgun!

The project starts from the standard Unreal Engine First Person Shooter starter pack. I created the robot model in Blender because I wanted to go with a low-poly aesthetic and I needed a model with armor that would match the model and meet some specific properties that I will explain below. The project code is almost entirely implemented with C++, while also using blueprints when more fit for the task.

# Samples
In the following section I will showcase and briefly explain some features of this project. All shooting modes are implemented using a simple function 
provided by the `BlastableComponent` Scene Component: `void Blast(FVector Location, float ImpactRadius)`. With this simple function you can implement many ways to 
damage the character. The `Location` is a position in world space where the center of the damage occured, and `ImpactRadius` is the damage radius. This means that damage
is represented as a sphere intersecting some parts of the character's armor. The only affected parts are static meshes tagged with `BlastableMesh`.

Also, sparks are added at the impact point for aesthetic purposes!

The two images behind the robot character are used to display the damage maps used as input for the destruction material. 

## Shotgun
The shotgun shooting mode will trace many rays randomly into a cone starting from the weapon muzzle, and the impact radius will be bigger when the shot ray is near the center of the cone.

## Marksman Rifle
The shooting mode is a line trace that starts at the weapon muzzle and goes in the direction of the center of the screen. The impact radius is fixed.

## Full Auto Rifle
This is the same as the marksman shot, but you can hold the shoot many shots per second:

## Damage Maps
The blastable component stores damage over the mesh surface using two maps (implemented with render targets): a **Damage Map** and a **Temporal Damage Map**. These maps are then fed to the armor material as texture parameters, so that they can be sampled from the armor shader and implement any effect you like. In my case, I wanted to poke holes in the armor with shots while making the hole border glow to represent melted metal. The Damage Map is used for the first effect, while the Temporal Damage Map is used for the second.  

Note that the damage is sampled from each map using the armor texture coordinates.
### Permanent Damage

As its name implies, this texture/render target is used to store the damage dealt to the enemy's armor since the game started. It is a 1024x1024 texture that can be sampled using texture coordinates to get the damage state in each position (damaged or not damaged). Since the texture has multiple channels, you can modify the way the data is stored in the texture to store a different type of data in each channel, such as damage types or the damage position/impact normal. On `BeginPlay`, the `BlastableComponent` will access the armor mesh and set the texture parameter `RT_UnwrapDamage` of its material to this render target.

### Temporal Damage
This texture stores the damage in the same way as the previous damage map, but it fades over time. This is useful for animated effects applied immediately after damage is dealt that should disappear over time, such as the melted metal effect around a bullet hole. Again, the `BlastableComponent` will set the texture parameter `RT_FadingDamage` in the armor material to be this texture.

# Implementation Details

The process of damaging the enemy armor looks like this:

1. We first trigger a damage event, this is implemented with the `BlastableComponent::Blast(FVector, float)` function we mentioned before. To damage the texture we need the damaged position and a radius.
2. Once the event is called, we want to check wich points in the surface of the armor are **inside a sphere** centered at the damage position and with the specified radius and mark them in the render targets. To do this we do a **texture unwrapping** for the armor mesh, the material used for unwrapping also marks which fragments lay inside the sphere.
3. Now that the surface is unwrapped, we take a **scene capture** twice, one for each render target.
4. The `TimeDamageRenderTarget`, the one that fades over time, also requires updating since the content changes every few milliseconds.
5. Now that the render targets are updated, these are used inside the armor material to display the damage sampling from the render targets.

In the following sections I explain this process more carefully.

## Mesh Unwrapping 

A more comprehensive guide on mesh unwrapping and painting can be found in this amazing tutorial from [kodeco](https://www.kodeco.com/6817-dynamic-mesh-painting-in-unreal-engine-4), but the general outline goes like this:

We want to create a damage map for our model surface that we can sample using texture coordinates. To do this, we:

1. Create a material with two parameters: the position and radius we mentioned before.
2. Mark a fragment as white if inside the damage sphere (using the AbsoluteWorldPosition node), and black otherwise.
3. Move this fragment to a horizontal plane in its corresponding position according its texture coordinates. You do this by substracting the fragment's position its *Absolute World Position* and adding its texture coordinates.
4. Take a Scene Capture using a *Scene Capture Component*

Note that one of the hardest parts is actually getting the scene capture right since it requires some carefully set up before capturing. You might end capturing the robot that should not show up, you can get a mad capture when the actor is rotated, or capture the Sky Map. For this reason I tried to set up all relevant configurations from the C++ class so that the resulting blueprint has its settings properly set by default. You can find the configuration 
for the scene capture component in [this function](https://github.com/LDiazN/ArmorBlasting/blob/43e2e5c155df63f687b75b28f3e6f65034493a35/Source/ArmorBlasting/BlastableComponent.cpp#L217). 

Another important thing is that the mesh has some requirements to be unwrapable with this approach, since we have some non-mentioned asumptions: 

1. **Unique texture coordinates**: The mesh should have a different texture coordinates at every point, or otherwise when the damage is being sampled some might show up damaged when nothing happened to them, which is confusing.
2. **Precise Physics**: The physics asset for the mesh should approximate the mesh as much as possible since a ray can hit the physics asset further from the mesh, and triggering a hit but with no damage being recorded in the damage map since it was too far from the actual mesh surface. For this reason I used a **low poly mesh** for the armor, so that I can use complex collisions with reduced overhead.
3. **UV Matching for each mesh**: Note that each armor part is its own independent mesh. But in order to get a consistent unwrapping and damage mapping each part should be aware of the other parts, so that they have a subset of UV coordinates that does not collide with other parts.

This is how the UVs look like in blender for the robot armor. Every part shares the same UV map and texture so that there's no overlapping on unwrapping.
