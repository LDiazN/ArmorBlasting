A simple Unreal Engine 4 sample project that showcases dynamic damage over meshes. Shoot at the armored robot to blast its armor and see through it. I also provide three different shooting styles to test how this effect behaves with some of the most common weapon types in FPS games: a marksman rifle, a full auto rifle, and the mighty shotgun!

The project starts from the standard Unreal Engine First Person Shooter starter pack. I created the robot model in Blender because I wanted to go with a low-poly aesthetic and I needed a model with armor that would match the model and meet some specific properties that I will explain below. The project code is almost entirely implemented with C++, while also using blueprints when more fit for the task.

# Samples
In the following section I will showcase and briefly explain some features of this project. All shooting modes are implemented using a simple function 
provided by the `BlastableComponent` Scene Component: `void Blast(FVector Location, float ImpactRadius)`. With this simple function you can implement many ways to 
damage the character. The `Location` is a position in world space where the center of the damage occured, and `ImpactRadius` is the damage radius. This means that damage
is represented as a sphere intersecting some parts of the character's armor. The only affected parts are static meshes tagged with `BlastableMesh`.

Also, sparks are added at the impact point for aesthetic purposes!

## Shotgun
The shotgun shooting mode will trace many rays randomly into a cone starting from the weapon muzzle, and the impact radius will be bigger when the shot ray is near the center of the cone.

## Marksman Rifle
The shooting mode is a line trace that starts at the weapon muzzle and goes in the direction of the center of the screen. The impact radius is fixed.

## Full Auto Rifle
This is the same as the marksman shot, but you can hold the shoot many shots per second:

## Damage Maps
The blastable component stores damage over the mesh surface using two maps (implemented with render targets): a **Damage Map** and a **Temporal Damage Map**. These maps are then fed to the armor material as texture parameters, so that they can be sampled from the armor shader and implement any effect you like. In my case, I wanted to poke holes in the armor with shots while making the hole border glow to represent melted metal. The Damage Map is used for the first effect, while the Temporal Damage Map is used for the second.  

Note that the damage is sampled from each map using the armor texture coordinates.
